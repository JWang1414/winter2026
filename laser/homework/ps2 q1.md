# Question 1

a.
$$
\sigma(\nu) = \frac{\lambda^{2}A_{21}}{8\pi} S(\nu)
$$
Lineshape function is,
$$
L(\nu) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\delta}{(\nu-\nu_{0})^{2}+\delta^{2}}
$$
Where $\delta$ is the half-width at half-maximum. Under the condition $\nu_{L}=\nu_{0}$ we have
$$
L(\nu) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\delta}{\delta^{2}} = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{1}{\delta}
$$
Cross-section should be,
$$
\sigma(\nu) = \frac{\lambda^{2}A_{21}}{8\pi} \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{1}{\delta} = \frac{\lambda^{2}A_{21}}{8\pi^{2}\delta}
$$
$$
\frac{(600\times 10^{-9})^{2}(2\times 10^{8})}{8\pi^{2}(10^{9} /2)} \approx 1.82 \times 10^{-15}
$$
- Still have to check the units, but I don't feel like it rn

b.
Note that
$$
\lambda_{0}^{2} = (600\times 10^{-9})^{2} \propto 10^{-13}
$$
Which is not proportional to my answer (on the order $10^{-15}$)

I find something smaller than this. Like due to the Doppler-broadening, or the small linewidth
- This doesn't make sense to me, wouldn't the broadening make the cross-section larger?
