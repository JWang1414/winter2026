The saturation determines the operational output intensity of the laser.
$$
g(\nu) = \frac{g_{0}(\nu)}{1+I /I_{s}} =g_{t}
$$
Where we have the threshold gain $g_{t}$ occurring when,
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} =0
$$
# Review of the Lorentz Model
This model treats the atom as a driven, damped, harmonic oscillator.
- That is, we attach a spring between the proton and the electron.

Our idea was to solve for the steady-state response, calculate the absorption, and then we brought in some quantum mechanics. That is, we defined,
$$
\ket{1} , \ket{2}
$$
As the ground and excited states, respectively.

Furthermore, the quantum adjustment, or quantum matrix element manifested as a line strength correction $f_{21}=\bra{2} \vec{x} \ket{1}$.
