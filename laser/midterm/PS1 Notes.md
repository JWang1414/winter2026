# Question 1
---
a.
From the results we have,
$$
e^{ -\Gamma t } = e^{ -1 /\tau }
$$
Where we have defined the variable,
$$
\tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma}
$$
Which tells us that $\Gamma ^{-1}$ is the lifetime of excited states. That is, the number of excited atoms falls to $1 /e$ at $1 /\Gamma$.

---
b.
Physically, the pump maintain the number of excited atoms above $p /\Gamma$, balancing spontaneous emission.

---
c.
Same as (a), tells us the lifetime of the loss of photons.

---
e.
I can simplify this to:
$$
p > \frac{\Gamma b}{a} = \Gamma \bar{N}_{2}
$$
At exactly this pump rate, no light is emitted from the laser

---
f.
Assume that $bq$ is the loss of photons in the cavity, and the output of the laser. Define these two components as:
$$
b = d+c
$$
Where $d$ is the output, and $c$ is the loss.

Above threshold we have,
$$
\text{Output} > d\bar{q} = b\bar{q} - c\bar{q}
$$
Substitute in $\bar{q}$ to find,
$$
\text{Output} > p - \Gamma \bar{N}_{2} - cq
$$
Which model the pump, spent emission, and loss, respectively.

---
g.
The loss from spontaneous emission is $\Gamma N_{2}$. So above threshold we have,
$$
\text{Loss from spontaneous emission} > \Gamma \bar{N}2 = \frac{b}{a} \Gamma
$$
