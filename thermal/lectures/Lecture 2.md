# Ergodicity
The hypothesis that, over a long time, a system will explore all accessible microstates with the same energy with equal probability
- Provides a natural explanation for uniform density, pressure, and temperature. Might not be flawlessly true, but it's a pretty decent assumption

It is possible for there to be theoretical "non-ergodic" states that do not thermalize. There typically arise from assumptions we make, and geometry
- Eg: If we assume the particles do not interact (common assumption) it's possible for no particle in the system to interact with a specific space
# Law of Large Numbers
Surprisingly, it is because of the incredibly high degrees of freedom present in macroscopic systems of particles, we can simplify them to just the averages. This arises because of a statistical law, one that states that as the number of particles increase, the variations in the system from the average will begin to decrease.
