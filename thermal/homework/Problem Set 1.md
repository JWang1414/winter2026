# Question 1
Assuming perfectly elastic collision, the component of the particle travelling along $\vec{n}$ will be reversed after the collision.
$$
\vec{v}'_{\vec{n}} =- \vec{v}_{\vec{n}}
$$
# Question 2
According to conservation of momentum,
$$
m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} = m_{1}v_{1}' + m_{2}v_{2}'
$$
Assuming a perfectly elastic collision:
$$
v_{1} + v_{1}' = v_{2}+v_{2}'
$$
Then,
$$
v_{1}' = v_{2}+v_{2}' - v_{1}
$$
Substitute,
$$
m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} = m_{1}(v_{2}+v_{2}' - v_{1}) + m_{2}v_{2}'
$$
$$
v_{1} + \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} v_{2} = v_{1}+v_{2}' - v_{1} + \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} v_{2}'
$$
$$
v_{2}' = \frac{m_{2}v_{2} - m_{1}(v_{2}-2v_{1})}{m_{1}+m_{2}} = v_{2} - \frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{2}-v_{1})
$$
Now solve for $v_{1}'$
$$
v_{1}' = v_{2}+\left( v_{2} - \frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{2}-v_{1}) \right)  - v_{1} = v_{1} - \frac{2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{1}-v_{2})
$$
- I have isolated so that these components are purely in the $\vec{n}$ direction
- Since this is where all the momentum transfer is, I can assume the momentum and velocity in the perpendicular direction will stay identical. So, this problem has become a 1-D one
# Question 3
I have already done this, just replace 1 and 2 with $i$ and $j$. Both of the previous problems can be solved in 1-D if you choose the right coordinates.
