# Question 1
Assuming perfectly elastic collision, the component of the particle travelling along $\vec{n}$ will be reversed after the collision.
$$
\vec{v}'_{\vec{n}} =- \vec{v}_{\vec{n}}
$$
# Question 2
According to conservation of momentum,
$$
m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} = m_{1}v_{1}' + m_{2}v_{2}'
$$
Assuming a perfectly elastic collision:
$$
v_{1} + v_{1}' = v_{2}+v_{2}'
$$
Then,
$$
v_{1}' = v_{2}+v_{2}' - v_{1}
$$
Substitute,
$$
m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} = m_{1}(v_{2}+v_{2}' - v_{1}) + m_{2}v_{2}'
$$
$$
v_{1} + \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} v_{2} = v_{1}+v_{2}' - v_{1} + \frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} v_{2}'
$$
$$
v_{2}' = \frac{m_{2}v_{2} - m_{1}(v_{2}-2v_{1})}{m_{1}+m_{2}} = v_{2} - \frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{2}-v_{1})
$$
Now solve for $v_{1}'$
$$
v_{1}' = v_{2}+\left( v_{2} - \frac{2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{2}-v_{1}) \right)  - v_{1} = v_{1} - \frac{2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} (v_{1}-v_{2})
$$
- I have isolated so that these components are purely in the $\vec{n}$ direction
- Since this is where all the momentum transfer is, I can assume the momentum and velocity in the perpendicular direction will stay identical. So, this problem has become a 1-D one
# Question 3
I have already done this, just replace 1 and 2 with $i$ and $j$. Both of the previous problems can be solved in 1-D if you choose the right coordinates.
# Question 4
Based on lines 142 and 150, the velocities are updated in the functions `collide_pair` and `reflect_wall`
# Question 5
`t_last` is responsible for keeping track of the last time a particle collided with something, either another particle, or a wall.

The use of `t_last` enables the use of a priority queue, where instead of simulating the dynamics of the full system at all times, the simulation updates only when it needs to: when a collision event happens.
# Question 6
The rightmost particle has collided with the right wall. `push_pair` is responsible for computing the time at which this particle will collide with another particle, and then adding it to the priority queue.
# Question 7
The plots differ in the two cases because one is seeded and one is unseeded. The randomized distribution generated by a computer is determined by a seed, in this case `252`. This means that, in the first case, the velocity distribution will always be the same, whereas in the second case they will be different.
- I have the images attached in the `temp_images` folder
- Only one image for the `252` seed, so just use the same image twice
