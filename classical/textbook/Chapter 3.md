# Newton’s laws
- *First law*: A body moves with constant velocity (which may be zero) unless acted on by a force.
- *Second law*: The time rate of change of the momentum of a body equals the force acting on the body.
- *Third law*: For every force on one body, there is an equal and opposite force on another body

The first law provides us a definition of zero force, and the *inertial frame* (the frame of reference when the first law holds)

The second law is the familiar statement that $\vec{F}=m\vec{a}=m\ddot{x}$. It is valid only in an inertial frame.
